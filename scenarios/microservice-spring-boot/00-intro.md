## What is Spring Boot?

[Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot) is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based 
applications with an embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertowt 
hat you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar** Spring Boot also allows producing a war 
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries 
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.

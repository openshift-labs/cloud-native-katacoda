The **gateway-vertx** project shows the components of 
a Vert.x project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best 
practices. Run the following command to examine the Maven project structure.

```

```{{execute T1}}

This is a minimal Vert.x project with support for RESTful services. This project currently contains no code
other than the main class, `GatewayVerticle.java` which is there to bootstrap the Vert.x application. Verticles
are encapsulated parts of the application that can run completely independently and communicate with each other
via the built-in event bus in Vert.x. Verticles get deployed and run by Vert.x in an event loop and therefore it 
is important that the code in a Verticle does not block. This asynchronous architecture allows Vert.x applications 
to easily scale and handle large amounts of throughput with few threads. All API calls in Vert.x by default are non-blocking and support this concurrency model.

Although you can have multiple, there is currently only one Verticle created in the **gateway-vertx** project. 

Examine `GatewayVerticle.java`. Here is what happens in this verticle:

1. A Verticle is created
2. **Router** is used for mapping the REST endpoints
3. A REST endpoint is created to return a static response
3. An HTTP Server is created to listen on port 8080

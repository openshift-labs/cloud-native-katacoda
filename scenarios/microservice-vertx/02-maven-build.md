You can use Maven to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully. 

> Make sure to run the `package` Maven goal and not `install`. The latter would 
> download a lot more dependencies and do things you don't need yet!

```
mvn package
```{{execute T1}}

You should see a **BUILD SUCCESS** in the logs.

Once built, the resulting jar archive is located in the `target/` directory:

```
ls target/*.jar
```{{execute T1}}

The listed jar archive, `gateway-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` is an uber-jar with all the 
dependencies required packaged in the jar archive to enable running the application with `java -jar`.

Now that the project is ready, let's get coding!
